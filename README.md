# react-dnd-accessible-backend

An add-on backend for `react-dnd` that provides support for keyboards and screenreaders by default.
Keep writing the same drag and drop code while enabling more users to interact with your app.

## Basic Usage

`react-dnd-accessible-backend` is not a _replacement_ backend for `react-dnd`, but rather an
_additional_ one. This means you will most likely need to compose backends together to get all of
the functionality you would like (mouse dragging, keyboards, pointer dragging on mobile, etc).

One of the easiest ways to do this is with `react-dnd-multi-backend` and it's transition system.
